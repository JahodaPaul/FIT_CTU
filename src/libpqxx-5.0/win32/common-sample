# Common options for Visual C++ makefiles to build libpqxx and its regression
# test.
# THE ORIGINAL OF THIS FILE IS CALLED common-sample; DON'T EDIT THE ORIGINAL or
# you may lose your changes when you upgrade your libpqxx sources.
# Instead, copy "common-sample" to "common" and edit just the file "common".

# Caution: on Windows, some environments, such as the "make" that comes with
# Visual C++, expect you to use backslashes as path separators (for example,
# "C:\src\libpqxx") whereas others like MinGW want you to use more conventional
# slashes (as in "C:/src/libpqxx").

# Depending on your STL library min/max need to be defined.  Using STLport
# there is no need for libpqxx to redefine these for me.

# The next line gives us the directory under which all PostgreSQL include
# directories, DLLs and LIB files can be found.
#
# If you built PostgreSQL from source, this is probably the only line you
# will need to change.
#
# If you installed PostgreSQL using the One Click Installer from EnterpriseDB,
# comment out the following line and uncomment the line after it.
#
# Edit the appropriate line to match your specific installation.

PGSQLSRC="C:\Sources\postgresql-9.1.1\src"

#PGSQLSRC="C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.1"

# This is the directory where the Postgres header files, e.g. postgres_ext.h,
# are found.

PGSQLINC=$(PGSQLSRC)\include

# This is the directory where the libpq header files, e.g. libpq-fe.h,
# are found.  If you used the One Click Installer, comment out the next line
# and uncomment the one following it:

LIBPQINC=$(PGSQLSRC)\interfaces\libpq

#LIBPQINC=$(PGSQLSRC)\include

# This is the directory where the release build of the libpq DLL
# and its corresponding LIB file are found, as well as the names of
# those two files.
#
# If you installed PostgreSQL using the One Click Installer from EnterpriseDB,
# comment out the next three lines and uncomment the following three.
#
# If you are using MinGW, remove the "Release" part from LIBPQPATH.

LIBPQPATH=$(PGSQLSRC)\interfaces\libpq\Release
LIBPQDLL=libpq.dll
LIBPQLIB=libpqdll.lib

#LIBPQPATH=$(PGSQLSRC)\lib
#LIBPQDLL=libpq.dll
#LIBPQLIB=libpq.lib

# This is the directory where the debug build of the libpq DLL
# and its corresponding LIB file are found, as well as the names of
# those two files.
#
# NOTE: If you don't have access to a debug build of libpq, just
# provide the same information as above here. The debug builds of
# libpqxx will reference the release version of libpq, which will
# only limit your ability to debug libpq sources but otherwise should
# work just fine.
#
# If you installed PostgreSQL using the One Click Installer from EnterpriseDB,
# comment out the next three lines and uncomment the following three.

LIBPQDPATH=$(PGSQLSRC)\interfaces\libpq\Debug
LIBPQDDLL=libpqd.dll
LIBPQDLIB=libpqddll.lib

#LIBPQDPATH=$(PGSQLSRC)\lib
#LIBPQDDLL=libpq.dll
#LIBPQDLIB=libpq.lib
