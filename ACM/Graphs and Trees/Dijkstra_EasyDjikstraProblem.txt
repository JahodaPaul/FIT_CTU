Determine the shortest path between the specified vertices in the graph given in the input data.

Input
first line - one integer - number of test cases
For each test case the numbers V, K (number of vertices, number of edges) are given,
Then K lines follow, each containing the following numbers separated by a single space: 
ai, bi, ci
It means that the graph being described contains an edge from ai to bi,
with a weight of ci.
Below the graph description a line containing a pair of integers A, B is present.
The goal is to find the shortest path from vertex A to vertex B.
All numbers in the input data are integers in the range 0..10000.
Output
For each test case your program should output (in a separate line) a single number C - the length of the shortest path from vertex A to vertex B. In case there is no such path, your program should output a single word "NO" (without quotes)
