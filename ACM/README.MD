## About

### This repository
I have picked some interesting or useful (in terms of preparation for ACM-ICPC) problems and will be expanding this collection continuously. All the solutions here have been accepted by the judges.<br />
All the files are in format ```<algorithm>_<name>.<suffix>```.<br />
```<algorithm>``` represents name of the algorithm used to solved the problem.<br />
```<name>``` represents name of the problem.<br />
```<suffix>``` files that have ".txt" or ".pdf" suffix contain problem statement and original link to the problem. Files that have other suffix contain the problem solution.

### BI-ACM course
The course focuses mainly on gifted students, but everybody is welcome. Every week there is a training where you try to solve as many algorithmic problems as possible. You can solve problems in a team of up to three people. At the end of training, there is an editorial, where the correct solutions are presented. For solving a problem during the training you get more point. You can also get some points if you submit correct solution before the next training.

The table below shows how many points we received for solving a single problem.
|              | During training | After training |
|--------------|:---------------:|:--------------:|
| 1st semester |        12       |        6       |
| 2nd semester |        6        |        3       |
| 3rd semester |        6        |        3       |
