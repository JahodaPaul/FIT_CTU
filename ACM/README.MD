## Problems solved in preparation for [ACM ICPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest)

## About
I have picked some interesting or useful (in terms of preparation for ACM-ICPC) problems and will be expanding this collection continuously. All the solutions here have been accepted by the judges.<br />
All the files are in format ```<name>_<algorithm>.<suffix>```.
```<name>``` represents name of the problem.
```<algorithm>``` represents name of the algorithm used to solved the problem.
```<suffix>``` files that have ".txt" suffix contain problem statement and original link to the problem. Files that have other suffix contain the problem solution.

## Results
Always recieved an A.
