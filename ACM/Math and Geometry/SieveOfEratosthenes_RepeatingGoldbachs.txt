The Goldbach Conjecture states that any even number x ≥ 4 can be expressed as the sum of two
primes. It can be verified that the conjecture is true for all x ≤ 10^6
.
Define a Goldbach step as taking x (4 ≤ x ≤ 10^6), finding primes p and q (with p ≤ q) that sum
to x, and replacing x with q − p. If there are multiple pairs of primes which sum to x, we take the
pair with the largest difference. That difference must be even and less than x. Therefore, we can
repeat more Goldbach steps, until we can reach a number less than 4.
Given x, find how many Goldbach steps it takes until reaching a number less than 4.
Input
The input will consist of a single integer x (4 ≤ x ≤ 10^6).
Output
Print, on a single line, the number of Goldbach steps it takes to reach a number less than 4.
Sample Input and Output
20 3
30 4
40 5
