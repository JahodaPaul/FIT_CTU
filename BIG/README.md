## Semestral project for _Database Technologies for Big Data_ course (2018/19)

## About project
Analysis and visualisations of millions of data points from nonprofit organization DonorsChoose that allows individuals to donate directly to public school classroom projects. <br/>
The main focus of my analysis are Donors and their donations. Used technologies include Spark, Hadoop, Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana. 

## Reproducibility
To reproduce this work you need to first download data from [https://www.kaggle.com/donorschoose/io](https://www.kaggle.com/donorschoose/io) and unzip it into BIG/logtash/datasets/ folder. Then all you have to do is follow the instructions in [documentation](/Documentation.pdf) where you will also find  visualiasations and project results. Sadly, the documentation is only in Czech language.

All Kibana objects (visualisations, dashboard) are in the kibana_objects.json file. 

## Overall result
Gained maximum points obtainable.

## Dependencies:
- docker and docker-compose
