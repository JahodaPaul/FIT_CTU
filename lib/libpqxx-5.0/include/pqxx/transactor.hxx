/// Wrapper for transactions that automatically restarts them on failure
/**
 * @addtogroup transactor Transactor framework
 *
 * Some transactions may be replayed if their connection fails, until they do
 * succeed.  These can be encapsulated in a transactor-derived classes.  The
 * transactor framework will take care of setting up a backend transaction
 * context for the operation, and of aborting and retrying if its connection
 * goes bad.
 *
 * The transactor framework also makes it easier for you to do this safely,
 * avoiding typical pitfalls and encouraging programmers to separate their
 * transaction definitions (essentially, business rules implementations) from
 * their higher-level code (application using those business rules).  The
 * former go into the transactor-based class.
 *
 * Pass an object of your transactor-based class to connection_base::perform()
 * to execute the transaction code embedded in it (see the definitions in
 * pqxx/connection_base.hxx).
 *
 * connection_base::perform() is actually a template, specializing itself to any
 * transactor type you pass to it.  This means you will have to pass it a
 * reference of your object's ultimate static type; runtime polymorphism is
 * not allowed.  Hence the absence of virtual methods in transactor.  The
 * exact methods to be called at runtime *must* be resolved at compile time.
 *
 * Your transactor-derived class must define a copy constructor.  This will be
 * used to create a "clean" copy of your transactor for every attempt that
 * perform() makes to run it.

   * the operation fails, but not if the connection is broken in such a way as
   * to leave the library in doubt as to whether the operation succeeded.  In
   * that case, an in_doubt_error will be thrown.
   *
   * Recommended practice is to allow this operator to modify only the
   * transactor itself, and the dedicated transaction object it is passed as an
   * argument.  This is what makes side effects, retrying etc. controllable in
   * the transactor framework.
