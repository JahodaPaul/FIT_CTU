/// Binary data corresponding to PostgreSQL's "BYTEA" binary-string type.
/** @addtogroup escaping String escaping
 *
 * This class represents a binary string as stored in a field of type bytea.
 * The raw value returned by a bytea field contains escape sequences for certain
 * characters, which are filtered out by binarystring.
 *
 * Internally a binarystring is zero-terminated, but it may also contain zero
 * bytes, just like any other byte value.  So don't assume that it can be
 * treated as a C-style string unless you've made sure of this yourself.
 *
 * The binarystring retains its value even if the result it was obtained from is
 * destroyed, but it cannot be copied or assigned.
 *
 * \relatesalso transaction_base::esc_raw
 *
 * To convert the other way, i.e. from a raw series of bytes to a string
 * suitable for inclusion as bytea values in your SQL, use the transaction's
 * esc_raw() functions.
 *
 * @warning This class is implemented as a reference-counting smart pointer.
 * Copying, swapping, and destroying binarystring objects that refer to the same
 * underlying data block is <em>not thread-safe</em>.  If you wish to pass
 * binarystrings around between threads, make sure that each of these operations
 * is protected against concurrency with similar operations on the same object,
 * or other objects pointing to the same data block.
