	Writing database code can be tricky.  One of the most complicated
	areas is dealing with unexpected error conditions, such as losing
	one's connection to the database server.  For long-running processes
	you'll frequently find yourself rewriting code for a simple
	transaction to make it:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Attempt to perform the transaction.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Check for "connection lost" errors.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Attempt to restore the connection.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Repeat until the transaction succeeds.
	  </p></li></ul></div><p>
	This is bad for the heart, and clutters up your code besides.  The
	<code class="literal">transactor</code> framework will take this work out of
	your hands if you let it.
      </p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="functors"></a>Functors</h3></div></div></div><p>
	  The mechanism is based on the concept of
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>Functors</em></span>, a powerful object-oriented design
	  pattern that replaces the older practice of passing callback
	  functions (or hooks, as they're sometimes called, or exits) to
	  foreign code.  Unlike classic callback functions, Functors provide
	  an elegant way of maintaining custom state in your callback code,
	  when the exact form or size of that state was not known in advance
	  to the writer of the foreign code that will eventually invoke your
	  callback.
	</p><p>
	  Functors in C++ are simple objects that can be invoked just like
	  functions or function pointers can, by virtue of providing the
	  function invocation operator, <code class="function">operator()</code>.
	</p><p>
	  A simple functor could look like this:
	</p><pre class="programlisting">
	  struct HelloFunctor
	  {
	  void operator()() { cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World" &lt;&lt; endl; }
	  };
	</pre><p>
	  ...And once an object of this functor type has been created, it can
	  be "invoked" just as if it were a function:
	</p><pre class="programlisting">
	  HelloFunctor Hi;
	  Hi();
	</pre><p>
	  But the invoking code may also be foreign code knowing nothing
	  about the type of your functor.  The foreign code is usually a
	  template, so it automatically becomes "specialized" to your type of
	  functor when the one meets the other:
	</p><pre class="programlisting">
	  template&lt;typename FUNCTOR&gt; void DoFunctor(const FUNCTOR &amp;Hi)
	  {
	  Hi();
	  }
	</pre><p>
	  The great thing about functors is that they can carry state.  This
	  is most useful when you need to pass a functor object to foreign
	  code like <code class="function">DoFunctor</code> above, but you need
	  certain extra parameters to be passed to your functor that the
	  foreign code isn't going to pass.  The classic C solution to this
	  problem is to let you pass both a function pointer and a
	  pointer-to-<code class="literal">void</code> as a method of letting you
	  provide any type of data of your liking to it.  This generally
	  makes programs a little harder to read, and is not very safe or
	  convenient.
	</p><p>
	  With functors, there is a better way to do the same thing.  Let's
	  say you want to adapt the <code class="literal">HelloFunctor</code> class to
	  print its output to a different output stream.  What you'd really
	  like to do is add a parameter to your <code class="literal">()</code>
	  operator to indicate which stream to print to:
	</p><pre class="programlisting">
	  void operator()(ostream &amp;Stream)
	  {
	  Stream &lt;&lt; "Hello World" &lt;&lt; endl;
	  }
	</pre><p>
	  Unfortunately, <code class="function">DoFunctor</code> doesn't know about
	  this new parameter, let alone what argument to pass!  So instead,
	  let's make this
	  <code class="literal">Stream</code> a class member:
	</p><pre class="programlisting">
	  struct HelloFunctor
	  {
	  ostream &amp;Stream;

	  // Set Stream when creating a HelloFunctor
	  explicit HelloFunctor(ostream &amp;S) : Stream(S) { }

	  // Print to output stream selected at construction time
	  void operator()()
	  {
	  Stream &lt;&lt; "Hello World" &lt;&lt; endl;
	  }
	  };
	</pre><p>
	  We can now provide the necessary information (ie., which stream to
	  print to) to our <code class="literal">HelloFunctor</code> before we pass it
	  to <code class="function">DoFunctor</code>:
	</p><pre class="programlisting">
	  HelloFunctor Hi1(cout), Hi2(cerr);

	  DoFunctor(Hi1);  // Print to cout
	  DoFunctor(Hi2);  // Print to cerr
	</pre><p>
	  Naturally a functor's <code class="literal">()</code> operator may also return
	  some other type than <code class="literal">void</code>, and it may take
	  arguments just like any other function.  This mechanism is used
	  extensively by the STL to sort containers, to find items in sorted
	  containers like <code class="literal">set</code> or <code class="literal">map</code>, and
	  so on.

	  A transactor is a functor derived from an instantiation of
	  <code class="filename">libpqxx</code>'s <code class="literal">transactor</code> class
	  template.  Instead of writing your database transaction inline with
	  the rest of your code, you encapsulate it in your functor's
	  <code class="literal">()</code> operator.  When the time comes to execute
	  your transaction, you create an object of your functor type and
	  pass it to the <code class="function">perform</code> method of your
	  <code class="literal">connection</code> to the database.
	</p><p>
	  <code class="function">perform</code> will make a copy of your transactor
	  (which means it needs to be copy-constructible, by the way).  It
	  will also create a transaction object and invoke your transactor's
	  <code class="literal">()</code> operator, passing the transaction object to
	  it.  All your transactor needs to do is perform its queries on this
	  object and return, after which <code class="function">perform</code> will
	  commit the transaction.  If your <code class="literal">()</code> operator
	  throws an exception instead, <code class="function">perform</code> will
	  discard the copy of your original transactor, and try again with a
	  new copy until it either succeeds or eventually gives up
	  <a href="#ftn.idp24837788" class="footnote" id="idp24837788"><sup class="footnote">[6]</sup></a>.
	  If the connection is lost, the transaction will fail but
	  <code class="function">perform</code> will restore it transparently and
	  simply try again.
	</p><p>
	  To make all this work, your transactor's <code class="literal">()</code>
	  operator must make <span class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span> changes to the rest of
	  your program's state.  Any intermediate results, data to be
	  processed, and so on, must stay within your transactor, and be
	  destroyed when the transactor is.  That is the magic trick that
	  allows <code class="function">perform</code> to create copies of your
	  transactor and use them to rerun the transaction as
	  many times as needed, without your program noticing.
	</p><p>
	  So how does your transactor pass query results back to the outside
	  world once it's done?  For this purpose, you may redefine
	  <code class="literal">transactor</code>'s <code class="function">on_commit</code>
	  member function to pass any data back to the rest of your program.
	  This member function will be called only if your transaction
	  succeeded.
	</p><p>
	  (You may also wish to go the other route, storing data to variables
	  outside the transactor right away, and override the
	  <code class="function">on_abort</code> and <code class="function">on_doubt</code>
	  functions to remove the data again if the transaction failed, but
	  this is much more likely to cause subtle bugs.)
	</p><p>
	  Please refer to the reference manual, the source code, and the test
	  programs that come with <code class="filename">libpqxx</code> to learn more
	  about how transactors work.

	      <code class="function">perform</code> gives up if the transaction fails
	      too many times in succession.  The maximum number of attempts
	      that are made can be passed to <code class="function">perform</code> as
	      an optional second argument.
