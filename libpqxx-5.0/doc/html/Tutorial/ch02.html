      To work with <span class="productname">libpqxx</span>&#8482;, you need to be aware of
      at least the following classes.  These are all introduced in a dedicated
      namespace, <code class="literal">pqxx</code>:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	  <code class="literal">connection</code> represents a connection from your
	  program to a <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>&#8482; back-end server.
	  Naturally your program may open multiple connections, simultaneous or
	  not, to any number of databases.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  <code class="literal">work</code>, actually a typedef for the
	  <code class="literal">transaction</code> class template, represents a
	  transaction being executed in the context of a
	  <code class="literal">connection</code>. This is a unit of work that must be
	  completed as a whole by the database backend.  If execution fails,
	  everything done within that <code class="literal">transaction</code> is undone
	  by the backend as if it had never happened.

	  <a href="#ftn.idp21830668" class="footnote" id="idp21830668"><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a>

	  You may execute any number of transactions on a single
	  <code class="literal">connection</code>, but only one at a time.
	</p><p>
	  I recommend that you do not set up your own
	  <code class="literal">transaction</code>s, but have them managed for you
	  by a <code class="literal">transactor</code> instead (see below).
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  A <code class="literal">result</code> is a container holding the resulting data
	  coming out of a query or command executed in a
	  <code class="literal">transaction</code>.  It behaves just like a standard C++
	  container as found in the STL, although its contents can't be modified
          in any way.  (You can assign or copy it cheaply though; it's basically
          a smart pointer).  The rows held in the result in turn behave much
          like non-modifiable containers themselves.
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
      I would also like to use this opportunity to plug the
      <code class="function">esc</code> function, which you should use whenever you want
      to include a variable as a string in your SQL (eg. insert it into a text
      field in a table).  See below.
    </p><p>
      There are other classes that may be of interest to you, but which you
      don't necessarily need to be aware of for writing programs.  You will
      probably want to look them up at some point when it becomes necessary to
      figure out complex compiler warnings.
    </p><p>
      Some of the classes you may become interested in fairly quickly are:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	  <code class="literal">broken_connection</code> is an exception class that is
	  thrown if <span class="productname">libpqxx</span>&#8482; loses its connection to
	  the back-end.  It is derived from the standard C++ exception
	  <code class="literal">std::runtime_error</code>, and can generally be treated as
	  such.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  <code class="literal">sql_error</code> is an exception class that is thrown if
	  a query to the back-end fails.  Like
	  <code class="literal">broken_connection</code> it
	  is derived from <code class="literal">std::runtime_error</code>, but it also
	  carries information about the failed query.  This may be useful for
	  debugging.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  <code class="literal">icursorstream</code> is a way of iterating over a query
	  result using an SQL cursor.  This can be useful for selectively
	  retrieving parts of a query, or for retrieving and processing results
	  in chunks so your program can do useful work on one chunk while the
	  next is still coming in over a network connection.  Or you may want to
	  use this to give progress reports to the user between chunk transfers.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  <code class="literal">in_doubt_error</code> is an exception class to indicate a
	  rare and difficult error condition.  Explaining this is a bit painful,
	  since it invalidates some of what was said above (and is commonly said
	  in the database world).
	</p><p>
	  In theory, a "transaction" is an integral, atomic unit of work that
	  either fails or succeeds.  This is a beautiful idea, but in practice
	  there is nothing that cannot be broken.  There is a tiny risk that,
          like Schroedinger's Cat, the transaction can end up in an
          indeterminate state.  This happens when the connection to the backend
          is lost just when you were waiting for confirmation after completing
          your transaction.  Your transaction may have succeeded (in fact it
          probably has), but if the connection is lost during just this small
          time window, there is no way to confirm this to your application.
	</p><p>
	  When this happens, libpqxx throws an <code class="literal">in_doubt_error</code>
	  on the client side, which you may want to <code class="literal">catch</code> as
	  a special case.  If you do, make sure all alarm bells go off!
	</p><p>
	  See also the description for <code class="literal">robusttransaction</code>,
	  which sacrifices some performance to minimize this risk.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  <code class="literal">nontransaction</code> is just like a regular
	  <code class="literal">transaction</code> as far your code is concerned (except
	  that it's not a template).  The big difference is that where the
	  latter opens a back-end transaction to keep your view and
	  modifications of the database atomic, the former does
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>nothing</em></span> to maintain integrity.  It just passes
	  your queries directly to the database, with no enclosing transaction.
	  This difference is expressed by the fact that the other transaction
	  classes are derived from <code class="literal">dbtransaction</code>, an
	  abstract class that expresses the presence of a real backend
	  transaction, whereas <code class="literal">nontransaction</code> is not.
	</p><p>
	  This may give you better performance if your transaction does not
	  modify the database, but if it does, may have unforeseen implications
	  if you expect certain levels of consistency in the
	  database--especially if other processes or threads may be modifying
	  the database at the same time.  You'll probably only want to use this
	  in the following cases:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	      If you only want to read from the database, not modify it, and
	      you know that the data is not going to be updated while your
	      program is running.
	    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	      If you are interested in always getting the very latest
	      information out of your database, even if that means that you may
	      not get a temporally consistent view of the database.
	    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	      When making changes to the database schema; some operations may
	      not be supported by the backend inside backend transactions.
	    </p></li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  <code class="literal">robusttransaction</code> (a template just like
	  <code class="literal">transaction</code>) is essentially the same as a
	  <code class="literal">transaction</code>, ie. an atomic unit of work, except
	  that it works harder to prevent <code class="literal">in_doubt_error</code>s
	  from happening.  This comes at the cost of some performance, which is
	  one reason why this behaviour isn't the default.  It also creates
	  some extra tables in your database to keep track of what's happening.
	</p><p>
	  Use this class instead of plain old <code class="literal">transaction</code> if
	  you get <code class="literal">in_doubt_error</code>s in your application--but
	  only <span class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> thoroughly inspecting your code for
	  bugs that might be causing the problem, or you'll only be hiding
	  glitches that should be fixed instead.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  <code class="literal">transaction_base</code> defines the common public
	  interface for the <code class="literal">transaction</code>-like classes:
	  <code class="literal">nontransaction</code>,
	  <code class="literal">robusttransaction</code>, and
	  <code class="literal">transaction</code> itself.  To look up methods available
	  in these classes, see the definition (or documentation) for
	  <code class="literal">transaction_base</code> instead.
	</p><p>
	  You'll usually want to refer to the default
	  <code class="literal">transaction</code> type as <code class="literal">work</code>, a
	  typedef that means "<code class="literal">transaction</code> with default
	  (read-committed) isolation level."
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  <code class="literal">transactor&lt;&gt;</code> provides a framework that makes
	  it easier for you to write correct, robust transaction code to be
	  executed in a transaction.  You should generally try to write your
	  code as a class derived from <code class="literal">transactor&lt;&gt;</code>,
	  but this is not required.
	</p><p>
	  A <code class="literal">transactor</code>-derived class may select its own
	  "quality of service" in transactional integrity by choosing a
	  transaction type as its template argument, e.g.
	  <code class="literal">transactor&lt;robusttransaction&lt;&gt; &gt;</code>.  The
	  default <code class="literal">transactor&lt;&gt;</code> is equivalent to
	  <code class="literal">transactor&lt;work&gt;</code>.  Within your class you can
	  refer to the transaction type used as
	  <code class="literal">argument_type</code>.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  <code class="literal">notification_receiver</code> is an instance of the
	  Observer design pattern.  Any code connected to a backend may flag an
	  event using the <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>&#8482;
	  <code class="literal">NOTIFY</code> command.  Frontends connected to that same
	  backend database may be listening for an event of that name to occur.
	  A frontend using <span class="productname">libpqxx</span>&#8482; does this by
	  registering an observer object derived from
	  <code class="literal">notification_receiver</code>, which will be invoked by
	  <span class="productname">libpqxx</span>&#8482; to handle the event when it occurs.
	</p><p>
	  Something every programmer using notification receivers in PostgreSQL
	  should know, by the way, is that notifications are not delivered to
	  your program while it is inside a back-end transaction.  Nor are they
	  sent until the notifying process has committed any transaction it may
	  be in.  This makes sense from a correctness point of view (otherwise
	  your processing of the event might get rolled back just because the
	  transaction you're in happens to fail), but may be a little confusing
	  to the unaware programmer.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  <code class="literal">row</code> refers to a row of data within a
	  <code class="literal">result</code> object.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  <code class="literal">field</code> refers to one field within a
	  <code class="literal">row</code>.  A <code class="literal">field</code> contains one
	  retrieved value such as a number or a string, and can be read into
	  variables of various types such as <code class="literal">int</code>s or
	  <code class="literal">string</code>s.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  <code class="literal">result::const_iterator</code> allows you to enumerate the
	  <code class="literal">row</code>s in a <code class="literal">result</code> in a similar
	  way to the iterators defined by any standard C++ container.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  <code class="literal">result::row::const_iterator</code> similarly iterates
	  over the <code class="literal">field</code>s in a <code class="literal">row</code>.
	</p></li></ul></div><p>
      Finally, there are also some functions that you may want to know about,
      that live alone in the <code class="literal">pqxx</code> namespace without being
      part of any class:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
	  <code class="function">esc</code>, found in the transaction classes, is the
	  canonical way to use strings in your SQL.  This function escapes any
	  quotes, backslashes, and other characters in your input string that
	  would otherwise cause syntax errors (or worse, security holes) in your
	  queries when included directly.
	</p><p>
	  <span class="emphasis"><em>Use these functions</em></span> whenever you want to have a
	  variable string in your SQL queries.  If you don't, you'll be left
	  with annoying bugs or possibly even security holes in your program.
	  Use this function, use this function, use this function.  Please.
	  Make me proud.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  <code class="function">to_string</code> knows how to render many types of
	  values as strings.  This is used internally by
	  <code class="literal">libpqxx</code> to convert values coming out of or going
	  into the backend, and doesn't respect locale settings.
	</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	  <code class="function">from_string</code> is the inverse of
	  <code class="function">to_string</code>.  It is used by eg.
	  <code class="function">field::to()</code> to convert the incoming
	  field data (which is in text format) to the desired C++ type.
	</p></li></ul></div><div class="footnotes"><br /><hr style="width:100; text-align:left;margin-left: 0" /><div id="ftn.idp21830668" class="footnote"><p><a href="#idp21830668" class="para"><sup class="para">[1] </sup></a>
	      Actually <span class="productname">libpqxx</span>&#8482; provides three classes
	      doing this at various levels of reliability, called
	      <code class="literal">nontransaction</code>, <code class="literal">transaction</code>,
	      and <code class="literal">robusttransaction</code> for no, standard, and
	      best reliability respectively.  You probably shouldn't mess with
              <code class="literal">robusttransaction</code> though, because it comes with
              complications.
