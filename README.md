## Overall Results
Finished the graduation exams with A, A and defended thesis with higher mark A - excellent. Will continue my master studies at either Technical University in Munich or FEL CVUT.
  
## Advice
I strongly recommend against copying the code from this repository. The goal of university education is to acquire knowledge and to learn to think. To copy the code would not only harm you in your development as a person, but it could also prevent you from successfully finishing these courses as most of them have anti-cheating mechanism in use.
