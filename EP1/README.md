## Algorithmic problems solved for _Efficient Programming 1_ course (2018/2019)

## About
The course focused on algorithmic problem solving a efficient programming. Every two weeks the professor gave a lecture on a different algorithmic topic and then gave us new problem set. We solved the problems independently at home. After a week the professor explained the solutions to the problems and afterwards we could solve the remaining problems for a portion of points.

## Results
Solved more problems than any other student in the course before the solution was presented (23 out of 25).

## Advice
Do not copy these codes, they are meant only as a guide to get<br/> as much points as possible. Copying them will only hurt you.
